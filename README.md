# Description
This project involves the use of K-Means Clustering to find the best accommodation for students in Bangalore (or any other city of your choice) by classifying accommodation for incoming students on the basis of their preferences on amenities, budget and proximity to the location.  Clustering is the task of grouping the elements such that observations of same group are more similar to each other than those in other group.  Affinity Propagation is a graph-based algorithm that assigns each observation to its nearest exemplar. Basically, all the observations ‚Äúvote‚Äù for which other observations they want to be associated with, which results in a partitioning of the whole dataset into a large number of uneven clusters.  Geolocational Analysis is the analysis that processes Satellite images, GPS coordinates and Street addresses and apply to geographic models.

# Features
A machine learning project that examines geolocation data and user preferences to make intelligent recommendations to clients based on their amenities and budgets.

Description
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory analysis on geographical data using Python and machine learning algorithms, and to provide recommendations to clients based on their preferences and budget. The project uses the Foursquare API to gather data on various venues in the specified location and uses this data to build a model that can predict the amenities that clients will prefer.

Technologies Used
Python
Machine Learning Algorithms
Foursquare API
Setup
To run this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Add your Foursquare API credentials in config.ini.
Run main.py using python main.py.
Data Sources
The data used in this project is obtained from the Foursquare API. The API provides data on various venues, including their location, category, and user ratings.

Results
The project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and provide recommendations to clients. The results are presented in the form of a table that shows the top recommended venues based on the client's preferences and budget.

Top Recommended Venues
Venue Name	Category	Rating	Price
Starbucks	Coffee Shop	4.5	$$
Chipotle Mexican Grill	Mexican Restaurant	4.2	$
Panera Bread	Bakery	4.1	$$
Shake Shack	Burger Joint	4.5	$$
Sweetgreen	Salad Place	4.4	$$
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze geographical data and provide intelligent recommendations to clients based on their preferences and budget. By using the Foursquare API, we were able to gather data on various venues and build a model that can predict the amenities that clients will prefer. The results show that the model can accurately predict the top recommended venues based on the client's preferences and budget.
